In this work, we develop the weight management diary iOS App "Minimum".

"Minimum" records the change of weight compared to the previous records when the user inputs their current weight. The key point here is not just recording weight, but recording the change of weight. We created an app that presents the weight change in terms of fruit, making it an app that users want to show to their friends and share on social media.
